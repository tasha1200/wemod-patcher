  <h1>WeMod Patcher</h1>
</div>

<h4>WeMod patcher allows you to get some WeMod Pro features absolutely free. This script patches WeMod, thereby removing the daily usage limit (2h), etc.</h4>

## 👾 No malware? Is it safe for me?

Yes, this is safe. This script is open-source, and you can check the code yourself. I have no intention of harming you or your computer. The script does absolutely nothing with your computer and does not require Internet access. It only affects WeMod files.

## 💻 Does this script only work with older versions of WeMod like other unlockers?

With this patch you will be able to use the latest version together with Pro.

## 💫  What features will be available?

✅ Unlimited usage time <br/>
✅ Disabling automatic updates (optional) <br/>
✅ Automatic patching of new WeMod versions <br/>
✅ AI Game guides <br/>
✅ Saving mods <br/>
✅ Exclusive to pro subscription customization for hacks <br/>
✅ Hotkeys (hotkey functionality is broken after static patching for unknown reason) <br/>
❌ Connect phone <br/>


## 👀 How to use?

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/k1tbyte/Wemod-Patcher/releases) page.
2. Download latest version
3. Run and click the patch

## ❓ Q&A

- I applied the patch but when I inject I get stuck on 'Loading mods...'.
  - Just close WeMod and try again
- During the game, some hacks are enabled without my input
  - This is a bug after the static patch, you have to turn off hotkeys in WeMod settings
- VirusTotal claims that this program is a malware/trojan.
  - Perhaps the patcher does have the same signatures as malware (virtual memory patching). But this is a false positive, you can look at the source code or even build the patcher yourself.
- Does this application transfer any data to the Internet from my computer?
  - The short answer is NO. This application does not need access to the Internet. The most it does is download updates if you want it to.
- What makes this application better than other patchers?
  - All actions related to patches are performed on your computer. No files of unknown origin will be downloaded.
